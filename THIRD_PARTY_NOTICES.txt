puff.c
Copyright (C) 2002, 2003 Mark Adler
For conditions of distribution and use, see copyright notice in puff.h
version 1.7, 3 Mar 2003

puff.c is a simple inflate written to be an unambiguous way to specify the
deflate format.  It is not written for speed but rather simplicity.  As a
side benefit, this code might actually be useful when small code is more
important than speed, such as bootstrap applications.  For typical deflate
data, zlib's inflate() is about four times as fast as puff().  zlib's
inflate compiles to around 20K on my machine, whereas puff.c compiles to
around 4K on my machine (a PowerPC using GNU cc).  If the faster decode()
function here is used, then puff() is only twice as slow as zlib's
inflate().

All dynamically allocated memory comes from the stack.  The stack required
is less than 2K bytes.  This code is compatible with 16-bit int's and
assumes that long's are at least 32 bits.  puff.c uses the short data type,
assumed to be 16 bits, for arrays in order to to conserve memory.  The code
works whether integers are stored big endian or little endian.

In the comments below are "Format notes" that describe the inflate process
and document some of the less obvious aspects of the format.  This source
code is meant to supplement RFC 1951, which formally describes the deflate
format:

Python (https://python.org)

A. HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE
==========================

Python was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting
Mathematisch Centrum (CWI, see http://www.cwi.nl) in the Netherlands
as a successor of a language called ABC.  Guido remains Python's
principal author, although it includes many contributions from others.

In 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for
National Research Initiatives (CNRI, see http://www.cnri.reston.va.us)
in Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the
software.

In May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to
BeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team.  In October of the same
year, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations, which became
Zope Corporation.  In 2001, the Python Software Foundation (PSF, see
https://www.python.org/psf/) was formed, a non-profit organization
created specifically to own Python-related Intellectual Property.
Zope Corporation was a sponsoring member of the PSF.

All Python releases are Open Source (see http://www.opensource.org for
the Open Source Definition).  Historically, most, but not all, Python
releases have also been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes
the various releases.

    Release         Derived     Year        Owner       GPL-
                    from                                compatible? (1)

    0.9.0 thru 1.2              1991-1995   CWI         yes
    1.3 thru 1.5.2  1.2         1995-1999   CNRI        yes
    1.6             1.5.2       2000        CNRI        no
    2.0             1.6         2000        BeOpen.com  no
    1.6.1           1.6         2001        CNRI        yes (2)
    2.1             2.0+1.6.1   2001        PSF         no
    2.0.1           2.0+1.6.1   2001        PSF         yes
    2.1.1           2.1+2.0.1   2001        PSF         yes
    2.1.2           2.1.1       2002        PSF         yes
    2.1.3           2.1.2       2002        PSF         yes
    2.2 and above   2.1.1       2001-now    PSF         yes

Footnotes:

(1) GPL-compatible doesn't mean that we're distributing Python under
    the GPL.  All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute
    a modified version without making your changes open source.  The
    GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with
    other software that is released under the GPL; the others don't.

(2) According to Richard Stallman, 1.6.1 is not GPL-compatible,
    because its license has a choice of law clause.  According to
    CNRI, however, Stallman's lawyer has told CNRI's lawyer that 1.6.1
    is "not incompatible" with the GPL.

Thanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's
direction to make these releases possible.
